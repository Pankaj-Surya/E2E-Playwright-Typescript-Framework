Great! Since you've already created a **free GitHub organization**, you're on the right track to replicating how real companies manage DevOps workflows in GitHub.

Here’s a complete guide to **creating and configuring a GitHub Organization**, with **best practices** for team collaboration, security, and project structure.

---

## ✅ Part 1: How to Create a GitHub Organization (Recap)

### 🪜 Steps (Already Done by You)

1. Go to: [https://github.com/organizations/new](https://github.com/organizations/new)
2. Fill in:

   * **Organization account name** (e.g., `devops-team`)
   * **Contact email**
3. Choose the **Free Plan** (sufficient for private repos & teams)
4. Complete creation → You are now the **owner** of the org

<!-- USERNAME="djdjd@gmail.com"
PASSWORD="qY4f!gu8QmN2prq" -->

## ✅ Part 2: Post-Creation Setup – Team & Access Management

### 🔹 Step 1: Add Members to Your Organization

1. Go to: `https://github.com/orgs/<your-org>/people`
2. Click **"Invite member"**
3. Enter the GitHub usernames of your team members (your two personal accounts)
4. Choose their **role** (default: `Member`, changeable later)
5. Click **Send invitation**

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Create Teams (Like Real Companies Do)

> Teams are used to group permissions (e.g., Dev Team, QA Team, DevOps Team)

1. Go to: `https://github.com/orgs/<your-org>/teams`
2. Click **New team**
3. Create teams such as:

   * `developers`
   * `reviewers`
   * `devops`
4. Add the appropriate members to each team

You can later use these teams to set:

* PR reviewers
* Access to specific repos
* Code owner rules

---

## ✅ Part 3: Create Repo Inside Organization

### 🔹 Step 3: Create a Project Repo

1. Go to: `https://github.com/organizations/<your-org>/repositories`
2. Click **New**
3. Choose:

   * Owner: **Your Organization**
   * Repository name: `realworld-devops-project`
   * Init with `README`, `.gitignore`, license
   * Choose: **Private** or **Public**

> ✅ Your repo now lives under the org, e.g.:
> `https://github.com/devops-team/realworld-devops-project`

---

## ✅ Part 4: Configure Repo Like a Company Project

### 🔹 Step 4: Set Branch Protection

1. Go to Repo → `Settings` → `Branches`
2. Add branch protection to `main`:

   * Require PRs
   * Require review
   * Restrict pushes to `devops` team only (or just yourself)

---

### 🔹 Step 5: Set CODEOWNERS (Optional but Recommended)

File: `.github/CODEOWNERS`

```txt
# All files must be approved by the devops team
* @devops-team
```

This auto-assigns reviewers from the specified team.

---

## ✅ Part 5: CI/CD & Security (Best Practice)

### 🔹 Step 6: Setup GitHub Actions

Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: echo "Running tests..."
```

### 🔹 Step 7: Enable Security Tools

In Repo Settings → Code security and analysis:

* ✅ Enable Dependabot alerts
* ✅ Enable secret scanning
* ✅ Enable code scanning with CodeQL (optional)
